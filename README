DMO Tools is a little tool for handling the data archives in the
Digimon Master Online MMO game. Each archive consists of a file
map (*.hf) and a data file (*.pf). This tool can read and update
such files. It is a command line only tool so you can use it in
batch files of any kind of call it from inside other programs.

Important to note is that the files in the archives are identified
using a 32-bit number. There are no file names or file path stored
inside the archives. To deal with a file of choice you have to use
the matching file ID. You can find them in tables on the forum.



dmotools.exe <action> <params>
   Shows a help output with all possible actions

dmotools.exe filemap <filename.hf>
dmotools.exe filemapCSV <filename.hf>
   Prints the content of the file map <filename.hf> on the console. The CSV version of
   the command outputs the content in CSV format so you can load it with OpenOffice or
   other CSV aware applications.

dmotools.exe extractFile <filename.hf> <filename.pf> <fileID> <destFile>
   Extracts the file with the ID <fileID> from the archive <filename.hf/pf> and stores
   the content in the file <destFile>.

dmotools.exe extractAllFiles <filename.hf> <filename.pf> <destDir>
   Extracts all files from the archive <filename.hf/pf> into files with the automatic
   naming "file_<ID>.dat" (with ID matching the file ID) into <destDir>.

dmotools.exe diffFileMap <filemap1.hf> <filemap2.hf>
   Shows differences between the archive <filemap2.hf> compared against <filemap1.hf>.
   The output is given in CSV format with the first column stating if the file has
   been added (exists in filemap2 but not filemap1), changed (exists in both but the
   size changed) or has been removed (exists in filemap1 but no more in filemap2).

dmotools.exe extractDiff <filemap1.hf> <filemap2.hf> <filemap2.pf> <destDir>
   Extract differences between the archive <filemap2.hf> compared against <filemap1.hf>
   into files with the automatic naming "<change>_<ID>.dat" into destDir. "change" is
   "changed", "added" or "removed" similar to "diffFileMap". This is a fast way to see
   changes from one archive to the other examining the new files for their content.

dmotools.exe compactArchive <filemap.hf> <archive.pf> <destFilemap.hf> <destArchive.pf>
   Creates a copy of the archive <filemap.hf/archive.pf> by copying file data but removing
   unneeded padding. The new archive is written into <destFilemap.hf/destArchive.pf>.
   Entries in the data file have a constant padding added to them but some entries have
   more padding than required. This removes the unneeded padding reducing the file size.

dmotools.exe updateArchive <filemap.hf> <archive.pf> <fileID1> <pathFileData1> ...
   Updates files inside the archive <filemap.hf/archive.pf>. More than one file can be
   updated inside an archive by specificing more than on pair of fileID/pathFileData.
   The archive is first updated into temporary files then written back to the original
   archive files (YES, THIS MODIFIES THE ARCHIVE IN-PLACE!). Missing files are ignored
   silently. The temp files are used instead of reading the entire archive into memory
   because archives can be quite large (>150MB) to be friendly to less strong systems.
